# Corner Four

The players alternate turns, dropping a piece of their color in the top of a column. The piece will fall down to the further-down unoccupied slot.

The game is won when a player makes four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game is a tie if the entire board fills up without a winner.
